# Struct
This is the official download page for the Struct web application.

Struct is a web application I created for my thesis in college. Struct follows an educational game model where games are used to teach students data structures while teachers have access to the students' performace in the game.

Unfortunately, the website doesn't work anymore as expected because of deprecated functions in PHP. Additionally, the Flash games aren't also responding accordingly. However, the developer is on the process of re-creating the whole application into the latest version of PHP and converting the games into HTML5. You may find her progress in [here]()

Here are some screenshots of the website:
